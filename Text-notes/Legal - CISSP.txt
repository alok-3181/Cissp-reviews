		place to mitigate the damage
	- Due diligence means that the company investigated and properly identified all
		possible vulnerabilities and weaknesses
Due Care = acting responsibly
Due Diligence = having as much information as possible to make the best decisions

Responsibility
	- obligations and expected actions of a particular party
Accountability
	- the ability to hold a party responsible for certain actions
Proximate cause
	- an act or omission that produces a consequence
Incident Management
	- primary goal is to contain and mitigate any damage caused by an incident and
		to prevent any further damage
	- Incident handling should be closely linked to security training and awareness
	- Incident response team
		- ensure that there is a group of properly trained individuals that
			can follow a standard set of procedures when responding to an event
		- Virtual Team
			- ghost team made of experts from different areas that are not 
				located together
		- Permanent Team
			- dedicated to incidence response
		- Hybrid Team
			- some virtual, some dedicated
Incident Response Procedures
	1) Triage
		- looking at all available information
		- set priorities on how to deal with the incident
	2) Investigation
		- proper collection of relevant data to be used in later stages
	3) Containment
		- damage must be mitigated
		- physical and/or logical controls
	4) Analysis
		- looking at all data gathered to understand root cause
		- *must report findings ongoing to senior management
	5) Tracking
		- could take place in parallel with analysis
		- determine whether source of incident was internal or external
	6) Recovery
		- implement necessary fixes to ensure incident does not happen again

* Management needs to make the decision as to whether or not law enforcement should
	be called in to investigate a security breach
	
Computer Forensics
	- a science that is focused on all domains in which evidence is in a digital
		or electronic form
	- motive
		- the who and the why of a crime
	- opportunity
		- the where and the when of a crime
	- means
		- the abilities of a criminal to be successful
	- Locard's Principle of Exchange
		- a criminal will leave something behind and will take something
			with them when committing a crime
Forensics Investigation Process
	1) Identification
		- what kind of evidence are we finding
	2) Preservation
		- make sure the evidence is secured, preserved
		- create cloned image of primary evidence
		- chain of custody
		- time synchronization
	3) Collection
		- safely collecting the evidence, following standard procedures
		- are there legal requirements
	4) Examination
		- forensically examining the evidence, without modifying it in any way
		- looking for hidden evidence and extracting it
		- pattern matching
	5) Analysis
		- examine the evidence
		- more thorough examination
		- traceability
		- data mining
		- statistical analysis
	6) Presentation
		- summary
		- present to interested parties
	7) Decision
		- decide what the outcome is of the investigation
Primary Image
	- the evidentiary evidence
	- initial piece of evidence
	- hashed to prove it has not been modified
Working Image
	- exact duplicate of evidence
	- hashed to prove it has not been modified
	- investigation is performed on this image
	
	
Where is volatile data found?
	- registers and cache
	- process tables
	- arp cache
	- system memory
	- temporary file systems
	- special disk sectors
Chain of Custody of Evidence
	- history of everything that is done to this evidence
Lifecycle of Evidence
	- collection and identification
	- storage, preservation, and transportation
	- presentation in court
	- return of evidence to owner
	
- Types of Evidence
	- Best Evidence
		- Primary evidence used in a trial because it provides the most reliability
	- Secondary Evidence
		- Oral and copies of original documents
	- Direct Evidence
		- Can prove a fact all by itself and does not need any backup information. 
	- Conclusive Evidence
		- Cannot be contradicted
	- Circumstantial Evidence
		- Can prove an intermediate fact that can then be used to deduce or assume the existence of another fact
	- Corroborative Evidence
		- Supporting evidence used to help prove an idea or point
		- Supplementary to primary evidence
	- Opinion Evidence
		- The opinion rule says that witnesses must testify to only the facts of the issue and not their opinion of the facts
	- Hearsay Evidence
		- Second-hand evidence that has no first-hand proof of accuracy or reliability

		
- Foundation of Admissibility for Evidence
	- Procedures for collecting and maintaining
	- Proof of how errors were avoided
	- Identification of custodian
	- Explanations for:
		- Why certain actions were taken
		- Why specific procedures were bypassed
- For the evidence to be considered complete it must present the whole truth of an issue 
- For the evidence to be sufficient it must be persuasive enough to convince a reasonable person
- For the evidence to be reliable it must be consistent with the facts (factual, not circumstantial)

- Exigent Circumstances
	- If there is an impending possibility that evidence may be destroyed law enforcement may act to seize the evidence in order to prevent its destruction.
- Enticement
	- Is legal and ethical
	- Giving something the opportunity to make a bad decision
- Entrapment
	- Not legal or ethical
	- Tricking somebody into making a bad decision

	
- Attack types
	- Salami Attack
		- Committing several small crimes with the hope that the large crime will go unnoticed
	- Data Diddling
		- Alteration of existing data
	- Password Sniffing
	- IP Spoofing
		- Can also be called masquerading
	- Dumpster Diving
		- Form of social engineering
	- Wire-tapping
		- Considered to be a passive attack
	- Cyber Squatting
