Operations Security

Job Rotation
- cross training
Least Privilege
- just the level of access they need to do their job
- nothing more
Mandatory Vacations
- chance to audit your job functions
Clipping Level
- set a threshold
- monitor for values that 
Assurance Level
- Operational Assurance
- entire structure of the system
- all elements operate in a way that validates security
- Lifecycle Assurance
- security is operating as it should throughout the lifetime
IPL (Initial Program load)
- mainframe term
- load OS into computers main memory
Asset Management
- what do we own
- hardware, software, humans, intellectual property
Trusted Recovery Methods
- System Reboot
- Emergency System Restart
- System Cold Start
What to do after a system crash?
- Enter into safe mode
- Fix issues, recover files
- Validate critical files
Security Concerns During a Trusted Recovery Process
- Boot up sequence should not be able to be modified
- Writing actions to system logs should not be bypassed
- A system forced shutdown should not be allowed
- Output should not be able to be rerouted
System Hardening
- Bastion Hosts
- removing unnecessary services, software, etc.
- removing unnecessary files
Remote Access Security
- AAA
- RADIUS
- Securing Cloud Access
- Mobile access
Configuration Management
- document and manage the configuration of our hardware
- Server or desktop images
- Patch management
- Documentation
Change Management
- Formal request for change
- Approval of the change
- Documentation of the change
- Testing of the change
- Implementation of the change
- Report on the change to management
Media Controls (DVD, USB, etc)
- Sanitization
- Purging
- Zeroization
- Degaussing
- Data Remanance
Network and Resource Availability
- Redundant hardware
- Hot swapping
- Fault Tolerance
- MTBF (Mean time between failures) - vendor driven metric
- MTTR (Mean time to repair) - user driven metric
- SPOF (Single point of failure) - no redundancy
RAID Types
MAID
- Massive array of inactive disks
RAIT
- Redundant array of independent tape
SAN
- Storage area network
NAS
- Network attacked storage
Clustering
- virtualized front end, pooled storage
Grid Computing
- combine individual computers into one
Email
- Protocols
- MIME
- S/MIME
- Architecture
Attack Types
- Session hijacking
- LOKI
- Password cracking
- Back doors
- Denial of service
- Distributed denial of service
- Man in the middle
- Mail bombing
- War dialing
- Ping of Death
- Teardrop Attack
- Fake login screens
- Traffic analysis
- Slamming and Cramming

Vulnerability Testing
- looking at the potential risk associated with our assets
- evaluate configuration
- patch levels
- address found concerns
- vulnerability scanners
- MBSA
- Windows Defender
- Nessus
- Kissmet
- Firesheep
Penetration Testing
- Discovery
- Enumeration
- Vulnerability Mapping
- Exploitation
- Report to Management
Knowledge Levels
- Zero knowledge (black box testing) 
- outside the network
- Partial knowledge (grey box testing) 
- outside the network
- Full knowledge (white box testing) 
- inside the network
Vulnerability Types
- Kernel Flaws
- occur below the GUI
- core buffer overflow for example
- Buffer Overflows
- input more data than the buffer can hold
- need to do boundary checking to prevent
- Symbolic Links
- use the OS structure to see data not normally accessible
- File Descriptor Attacks
- use metadata to attack data
- Race Conditions
- processes finish in the wrong order
- Directory Permissions
- proper delegation
