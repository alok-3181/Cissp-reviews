Segmentation: Segmentation is the process of dividing the memory of a computer into several segments.
Using paged virtual memory: Equal-sized block division of the memory address space is done in paging. The equal-sized blocks are known as pages.
Protection keys: MPK or memory protection key is a mechanism that divides the physical memory into particular size blocks (as small as 4 kiB). Each of these blocks has a numerical value associated,
Simulated segmentation: Simulation is used for program monitoring and interpreting the instructions of machine code in several types of computer architectures
Capability-based addressing -This method revolves around the replacement of pointers by capabilities or protected objects which can be created only through the use of privileged instructions. 
These instructions can be executed only by the kernel
Dynamic Tainting: This is a technique that protects programs from accessing memory illegally
Virtualization produces a different network that can be regarded as a hybrid of the new logical or virtual environment and the well-established network that is physically centered
