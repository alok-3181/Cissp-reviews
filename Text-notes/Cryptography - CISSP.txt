				of ciphertext always produced

		- Message Authentication Codes (MAC)
			- Authentication scheme derived by applying a secret key to a message in some form. 
			- Does not necessarily mean the symmetric key is used to encrypt the message. 
			- Three types
				- Hash
					- Provides integrity
					- Steps
						1) Sender uses a hashing algorithm on plaintext to generate a MD
						2) Plaintext and MD are sent to the receiver
						3) Receiver uses the same algorithm on plaintext to generate a new MD
						4) Receiver compares the two MD's to verify they are identical
				- HMAC
					- Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
					- Provides integrity and origin authentication
					- Steps
						1) Sender uses a hashing algorithm on plaintext and a secret key to generate a MAC
						2) Plaintext and MAC are sent to the receiver
						3) Receiver uses the same algorithm on plaintext and their own symmetric key to generate a new MAC
						4) Receiver compares the two MAC's to verify they are identical
				- CBC-MAC/CMAC
					- Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) 
					- Cipher-Based Message Authentication Code (CMAC)
						- Similar to CBC-MAC except it uses a more complex algorithm.
					- Provides integrity and origin authentication
					- Steps
						1) Sender uses a symmetric block algorithm on plaintext to generate ciphertext. The last block is the MAC. 
						2) Plaintext and MAC are sent to the receiver
						3) Receiver uses the same symmetric block algorithm on plaintext to generate ciphertext.
						4) Receiver compares the final block (the MAC) to verify they are identical
