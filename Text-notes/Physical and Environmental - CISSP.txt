CISSP â€“ Physical & Environmental Security

Bollard 
- crash barrier
- prevent direct drive up access

Natural Surveillance
- clear surrounding to remove hiding spots
- build on hill to see whats approaching
Guards in common access areas or lobbies

Issues selecting site
- Is it visible
- External areas, what else is in the area
- How close are emergency services and utilities
- Accessibility
- How prone is the area to natural disasters

Mantraps

Door types
- fail safe
- fail secure

Locations
- drop ceilings - could give access to secure areas
- firewalls that extend to ceilings
- wiring closets are secure, single point of access
- audio sensors
- cameras

Power
- electromagnetic interference
- motors
- cordless phones
- microwaves
- radio frequency interference
- florescent lights
- power excess
- spike
- surge
- power loss
- fault
- blackout
- power degradation
- sag
- brownout
- in rush current
Water
- broken pipes
- have drains with positive pressure

Air
- HVAC systems
- over pressure
- measure for humidity
- hygrometer used to measure humidity
- range should be 40% - 60%
- measure for temperature
- thermometer
- range should be 70F - 74F degrees

Fire Detection and Prevention
- Life comes first!!

- Prevention
- user education
- drills
- Detection
- when prevention fails
- smoke activated detectors
- heat activated detectors
- temperature based
- sprinkler heads
- Suppression
- stop the fire as quickly as possible
- fire ratings for extinguisher
- Class A
- common combustibles
- water or foam based
- Class B
- liquid fire
- gas or CO2 based
- not water
- Class C
- electrical fire
- gas or CO2 
- no water
- Class D
- chemical combustibles
- dry powder only
- no water
- Plenum grade cabling
- smolder, slow the spread
Gas suppression systems
- no longer use halon	
- FM200 has replaced halon
- Montreal Protocol
- banned the use of halon 
- is a greenhouse gas, damage the environment or ozone layer
Water suppression systems
- wet pipe systems
- fully charged
- water is in the pipe
- dry pipe system
- water is in holding tank
- no water in pipe initially
- preaction
- pipes are pressurized with air
- air is replaced with water
- deluge
- sprinkler heads are wide open
- largest volume of water can be dispensed
Locks
- delay device
- mechanical locks
- padlocks (warded)
- combination locks
- tumbler lock
- cipher locks
- cable locks
- lock bumping
Piggybacking
- one swipe and multiple access
Fencing
- 3-4 ft casual deterrent
- 6-7 ft better deterrent
- 8ft and up best deterrent
- gauge and mesh size
- pidas fencing
- interwoven mesh of wiring
Lighting
- total coverage if possible
- no islands of lighting
- critical areas should have 8ft coverage overlap with 2 ft/candle
- should point away, not at guards, glare protection
Cameras
- CCTV
- fixed focal lens
- varied focal lens can zoom
- depth of field
- iris, manual or automatic
Acoustic monitoring
Smoke detection
Electrical monitoring
Temperature monitoring
