Simple Rules of IP Addressing
- Each octet will be 0-255
- An address will not start with 0
	e.g. 0.110.98.2
- An address will not start with 255 
	e.g. 255.100.98.2
- An address will not typically end with 255

For the CISSP exam:
-----------------------------
	Octet #1
		- Will be 1-254
	Octet #2/3
		- Will be 0-255
	Octet #4
		- Will be 1-254
	First Usable Address
		- 1.0.0.1
	Last Usable Address
		- 254.255.255.254
	Provides around 4 billion Addresses

		- CSMA/CD (Collision Detection) - for wired LAN's
			- sense a change of voltage when a data packet is sent
			- one signal at a time
			- more than one signal causes a collision
			- collision is detected
			- both ends back off
